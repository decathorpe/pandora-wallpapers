# pandora-wallpapers

This package is a fork of the original (upstream) elementary wallpapers for
fedora: <https://github.com/elementary/wallpapers>

Compared to the upstream version, the debian packaging files and pictures with
unacceptable licenses have been removed. The remaining pictures are all in the
Public Domain.
